### Who Am I?

I'm a self-taught programmer who is learning to code for fun and enjoys learning new things.  I have the hope of one day working at a company as a software developer, and until then I'll keep working on learning each day and enjoying the process.  I have a fairly outgoing personality, so feel free to say hello!
